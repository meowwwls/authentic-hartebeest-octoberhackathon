# Modern Developer October Practice Hackathon

**team:** authentic-hartebeest  
**members:** [Mai X.](https://github.com/mxio) && [Melissa M.](http://github.com/meowwwls)

Over the course of the weekend of October 22nd, we set out to create our own versions of 4 [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) UI components: [Collapsible](http://materializecss.com/collapsible.html), [Dropdown](http://materializecss.com/dropdown.html), [Modal](http://materializecss.com/modals.html#!), and [Wave](http://materializecss.com/waves.html#!). Our goal was not perfect or total replication, but to accomplish as much as we could without the use of JavaScript. 

These are *not* the most semantic or accessible UI components. In **3** out of the **4** components, JavaScript was not *needed* at all. It was used for **Dropdown** to add the enhancement of dismissal of the dropdown when the body was clicked, and in **Collapsible** to add the enhancement of items that are already open being closed when clicked (for radio inputs; this is native for checkboxes). JavaScript was not used at all in **Modal**. It was, however, needed for most of the functionality in **Wave**.
